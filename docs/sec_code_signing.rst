Project Integrity
-----------------

To verify the integrity of DCOR-Aid, we manage access to the DCOR-Aid repository
via GitHub Team roles:

- **Triage**: The `Members team of DCOR-dev <https://github.com/DCOR-dev/DCOR-Aid/teams/members>`_
  has permission to triage (e.g. modify issues).
- **Core**: The `Core team of DCOR-dev <https://github.com/DCOR-dev/DCOR-Aid/teams/core>`_
  consists of people who are trusted to modify the source code in the project's
  version control system without additional reviews.
- There is no special role for *Commiters*. External contributors or members
  of the *Triage* team must create a pull request which is reviewed by a
  *Core* team member.
- Furthermore, we enforce 2FA for every member of the DCOR-dev GitHub
  organization.
