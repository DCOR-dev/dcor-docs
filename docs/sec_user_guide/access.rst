Accessing data on DCOR
======================

General remarks
===============
There are two ways of interacting with data on a DCOR instance,
via the web interface or via the API. With the web interface (not
covererd here), you can browse and search data in a convenient way with
your webbrowser. The API allows you to write custom scripts or libraries
(DCOR-Aid uses the API).

Note that there are two main DCOR instances. One for development and
testing (|dcor_dev_image| `DCOR-dev <https://dcor-dev.mpl.mpg.de>`_) and one for
production use (|dcor_image| `DCOR <https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de>`_). If you
are new to DCOR, please use the DCOR-dev instance to get to know the system.
If you are ready to get serious, move on to the production instance.

Access via DCOR-Aid GUI
=======================
It is possible to access all data on DCOR via your browser by visiting
https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de. However, you might want to consider using
DCOR-Aid instead, because:

- You can more easily browse circles and collection in the DCOR-Aid GUI.
- You can drag and drop resources from DCOR-Aid into Shape-Out
  (no need to copy and paste resource IDs).
- DCOR-Aid comes with a resource download manager.

    The DCOR-Aid setup wizard guides you through the initial setup.

If you installed DCOR-Aid for the first time, the setup wizard will
ask you to choose how you would like to use DCOR-Aid. If you are only
interested in public data, then choose the *Anonymous* option.

When DCOR-Aid starts, you will then see several tabs. The tab on the right
*Find Data* allows you to search the DCOR database for datasets and
resources. If you previously entered an API token, then you can also browse
all your datasets in the *My Data* tab.

To search for a particular dataset, simply type your search term in the
search field. If you are interested in more elaborate search options,
please create an issue at the
`DCOR-Aid issue page <https://github.com/DCOR-dev/DCOR-Aid/issues>`_.

    :target: ../_images/access_dcoraid_init.png

    The search results in the *Find Data* tab can be filtered by
    circle and collection. The tool buttons allow you to download
    datasets and resources and to view them online.



Access via DCOR-Aid Python library
==================================
The DCOR-Aid Python library provides you with a convenient interface
to the API. In principle, you are not limited to Python or DCOR-Aid,
as DCOR is basically `CKAN <https://ckan.readthedocs.io/>`_ and thus
uses the `same API <https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html>`_.

To initiate a connection with DCOR, run:

.. ipython:: python

  import dcoraid
  api = dcoraid.CKANAPI(server="dcor-dev.mpl.mpg.de",
                        api_key="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJqdGkiOiItNUVsLVBTZVdfZ3hMM2tKNnZXS0hWZUdsN011SnpMRlFRMHluNzdUanZqRnhLX3VNLTQyUHhsbVQwRl9yOGlZbklOam9CN3E4emZITDA0TCIsImlhdCI6MTYzNDY1NTc1OH0.VfHEPXdEZKjCZOP4bO8cl0OiIxsvZZksWyQLl80UGbI")
  # check that everything works
  assert api.is_available()

Here, ``server`` is the DCOR instance you are connecting to and
``api_key`` is your personal access token that you need if you would like
to access private data. You can omit ``api_key`` if you are only interested
in public data (or if you don't have an account).

The ``dcoraid.CKANAPI`` class gives you full access to the `underlying
API <https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/api/index.html>`_. For instance, you could
list all details of
`this dataset <https://dcor-dev.mpl.mpg.de/dataset/figshare-7771184-v2>`_ with:

.. ipython:: python

  dataset_dict = api.get("package_show", id="figshare-7771184-v2")
  # the first ten entries of the dataset dictionary
  for key in list(dataset_dict.keys())[:10]:
      print(f"{key:18s}: {dataset_dict[key]}")
  # all resource names in the dataset
  print([r["name"] for r in dataset_dict["resources"]])
  # the first ten metadata entries of the first resource
  for key in list(dataset_dict["resources"][0].keys())[:10]:
      print(f"{key:31s}: {dataset_dict['resources'][0][key]}")

.. note::

  Beware of the `dataset ambiguity`: On DCOR, a dataset (or package)
  contains a number of resources. You would call one of those resources
  a dataset in dclab. In other words, on DCOR a dataset consists of multiple
  DC files while with :func:`dclab.new_dataset` you always ever only open
  one resource.

Another very useful tool in DCOR-Aid is the ``APIInterrogator`` class
which sits on top of ``CKANAPI`` and, amongst other things, simplifies
searching for datasets:

.. ipython:: python

  # instantiate APIInterrogator
  air = dcoraid.APIInterrogator(api)
  # search for a dataset in a DCOR circle
  dbe = air.search_dataset(query="reference data",
                           circles=["figshare-import"])
  # the returned database extract (one hit)...
  len(dbe)
  # ...contains all metadata of the datasets matching the search query
  dbe[0]["name"]



Example: List all DC resources for a DCOR circle
------------------------------------------------
Let's say you are interested in all DC data files in a DCOR circle,
because you would like to run an automated analysis with dclab.
The following script creates a list of IDs ``resource_ids`` with all DC
files in the
`Figshare mirror <https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de/organization/figshare-import>`_
circle and plots one of the resources. For more information on how to
access DCOR data with dclab, please refer to the
:ref:`dclab docs <dclab:sec_av_dcor>`.

.. plot::

  import dclab
  import dcoraid
  import matplotlib.pylab as plt

  # name of the circle in question
  circle_name = "figshare-import"

  # initialize API (for private datasets, also provide `api_key`)
  api = dcoraid.CKANAPI("dcor.mpl.mpg.de")
  air = dcoraid.APIInterrogator(api)
  # get a list of all datasets for `circle_name`
  datasets = air.search_dataset(circles=[circle_name], limit=0)
  # iterate over all datasets and populate our resources list
  resource_ids = []
  for ds_dict in datasets:
      # iterate over all resources of a dataset
      for res_dict in ds_dict["resources"]:
          # identify DC data
          if res_dict["mimetype"] == "RT-DC":
              resource_ids.append(res_dict["id"])

  # do something with one of the resources in dclab
  with dclab.new_dataset(resource_ids[47]) as ds:
      kde = ds.get_kde_scatter(xax="area_um", yax="deform")
      ax = plt.subplot(111, title=ds.config['experiment']['sample'])
      sc = ax.scatter(ds["area_um"], ds["deform"], c=kde, marker=".")
      ax.set_xlabel(dclab.dfn.get_feature_label("area_um"))
      ax.set_ylabel(dclab.dfn.get_feature_label("deform"))
      plt.colorbar(sc, label="kernel density estimate [a.u]")
      plt.show()


Example: Order all resources of a DCOR circle according to flow rate
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You may need to order your resources according to a certain metadata
key. You can find all available metadata keys in the resource view
in the DCOR web interface (scroll all the way down and click "show more").
In this example, we order all resources according to flow rate
(the `"dc:setup:flow rate"` resource key).

.. plot::

  import dclab
  import dcoraid
  import matplotlib.pylab as plt
  import numpy as np

  # name of the circle in question
  circle_name = "figshare-import"

  # dictionary with flow rates of interest
  flow_rate_ids = {
      0.04: [],
      0.06: [],
      0.12: [],
      0.16: [],
      0.32: [],
      }

  # list of flow rates that don't fit into the above dictionary
  unsrt_ids = []

  # initialize API (for private datasets, also provide `api_key`)
  api = dcoraid.CKANAPI("dcor.mpl.mpg.de")
  air = dcoraid.APIInterrogator(api)
  # get a list of all datasets for `circle_name`
  datasets = air.search_dataset(circles=[circle_name], limit=0)
  # iterate over all datasets
  for ds_dict in datasets:
      # iterate over all resources of a dataset
      for res_dict in ds_dict["resources"]:
          # identify DC data
          if res_dict["mimetype"] == "RT-DC":
              flow_rate = res_dict.get("dc:setup:flow rate", np.nan)
              for fr in flow_rate_ids:
                  if np.allclose(flow_rate, fr):
                      flow_rate_ids[fr].append(res_dict["id"])
                      break
              else:
                  unsrt_ids.append((flow_rate, res_dict["id"]))

  # plot some statistics
  ax = plt.subplot(title=f"circle {circle_name}")
  plt.bar([f"{fr}" for fr in flow_rate_ids] + ["others"],
          [len(flow_rate_ids[fr]) for fr in flow_rate_ids] + [len(unsrt_ids)])
  ax.set_xlabel("flow rates [ÂµL/s]")
  ax.set_ylabel("number of datasets")
  plt.show()
