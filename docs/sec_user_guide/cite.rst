Citing data on DCOR
===================

.. warning::

    Do not cite your data using DCOR collection IDs or DCOR circle IDs.
    Users may add new datasets to circles/collections or remove
    datasets from collections. You should always cite the datasets.

If you are using DCOR data for publication purposes, please make sure
to properly cite the relevant dataset IDs. For instance, if you are
using `this dataset <https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de/dataset/figshare-7771184-v2>`_,
you should use the ID ``89bf2177-ffeb-9893-83cc-b619fc2f6663``
specified on that page. You should also include the ``dcor.mpl.mpg.de`` domain.

If you wanted to include this dataset in a bibliography, you could cite it
like this:

Philipp Rosendahl, Christoph Herold, Paul MÃ¼ller, Jochen Guck (2020).
*Real-time deformability cytometry reference data*,
Deformability Cytometry Open Repository (DCOR)
https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de/89bf2177-ffeb-9893-83cc-b619fc2f6663


.. note::

    There are plans to add a DOI-service to DCOR, such that you can
    add DOI numbers to public datasets. Please let us know if you are
    interested in that feature.
