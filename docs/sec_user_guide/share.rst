==================================
Sharing (private) data with others
==================================
This section is about dataset sharing. Whether you are working with private
or public datasets, DCOR offers you several ways of sharing datasets.



Permission system
=================

Public and private datasets
---------------------------
When uploading a dataset, you have the choice of *public* and *private*
datasets. Public datasets can be accessed by anyone. Private datasets
can only be accessed by members of the DCOR circle they were uploaded to.
You can also create DCOR collections, which may contain datasets that
belong to different circles. Every member of that collection has access to the
private datasets therein. You can always make private datasets public, but
not the other way around.


Circles: Sharing with colleagues
--------------------------------
DCOR circles are the "home" of a dataset. When you upload a dataset, you
have to specify a circle. A circle comprises one or more users who can be
attributed to the same company, organization, research group, or laboratory.
Every user can create circles and add other users to them. Users can have
different roles within a circle, depending on their level of authorization
to create, edit, and publish. All members of a circle have access to the
private datasets of that circle.


Collections: Sharing for collaborators
--------------------------------------
You can use DCOR collections to organize datasets across circles.
This could be to catalog datasets for a particular project or team, or on a
particular theme, or as a very simple way to help people find and search
your own published datasets. You can also use Collections to share private
datasets with other users. All members of a collection have access to the
private datasets in that collection.


Datasets: Simple sharing
------------------------
It is also possible to share individual private datasets with other users.


Publications
------------
Please note that circles and collections are in principle not citable.
You may add new datasets to circles and collections and you may remove
datasets from collections. You should always cite the datasets.
If you would like to cite a dataset on DCOR, please read :ref:`sec_cite`.


Sharing data via DCOR-Aid
=========================
After you have :ref:`uploaded your datasets <sec_upload>` via the *Uploads* tab,
you can add individual datasets to a collection in the *My Data* tab.

.. note::

    The *Sharing* tab is not implemented yet. Please manage members
    of collections and circles via the
    `DCOR web interface <https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de>`_.
