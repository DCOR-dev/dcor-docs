==================================
Sharing (private) data with others
==================================
This section is about dataset sharing. Whether you are working with private
or public datasets, DCOR offers you several ways
of sharing datasets.


Permission system
=================
When uploading a dataset, you have the choice of *public* and *private*
datasets. Public datasets can be accessed by anyone. Private datasets
can only be accessed by members of the DCOR circle they were uploaded to.
You can also create DCOR collections, which may contain datasets that
belong to different circles. Every member of that collection has access to the
private datasets therein.


Circles: Sharing with colleagues
--------------------------------
DCOR circles are used to create, manage and publish datasets.
A circle comprises one or more users who are part of the same company,
organization, research group, or laboratory. Every user can create circles
and add other users to them. Users can have different roles within a circle,
depending on their level of authorization to create, edit, and publish.
All members of a circle have access to the private datasets of that circle.


Collections: Sharing for collaborators
--------------------------------------
You can use DCOR collections to create and manage selections of datasets.
This could be to catalog datasets for a particular project or team, or on a
particular theme, or as a very simple way to help people find and search
your own published datasets. You can also use Collections to share private
datasets with other users.
All members of a collection have access to the private datasets in that
collection.


Datasets: Simple sharing
------------------------
It is also possible to share individual datasets with other users.


Publications
------------
Please note that circles and collections are not citable in publications,
because the datasets therein can change. If you would like to cite a
dataset on DCOR, please read :sec:`sec_cite`.


Sharing data via DCOR-Aid
=========================
After you have uploaded your datasets via the *Uploads* tab, you can
add individual datasets to a collection in the *My Data* tab.

.. note::

    The *Sharing* tab is not implemented yet. Please manage members
    of collections and circles via the
    `DCOR web interface <https://dcor.mpl.mpg.de>`_.
