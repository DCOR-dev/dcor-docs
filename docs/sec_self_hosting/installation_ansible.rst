Ansible-based Installation
==========================

`Ansible <https://ansible.com>`_ is a powerful and lightweight tool for
automating server installation and configuration processes.

Ansible is the recommended way of installing and maintaining DCOR. You can find
the Ansible playbooks for DCOR on GitHub at https://github.com/DCOR-dev/ansible-for-dcor.

If you would like to get started with a local virtual machine, you can use the
`staging inventory <https://github.com/DCOR-dev/ansible-for-dcor/blob/main/Readme_staging.rst>`_.
