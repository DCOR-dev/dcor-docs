; If we don't want to cache the files that users want to download
; (i.e. set `proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;` in nginx), then we have to
; set socket-timeout to a very large number (e.g. 7200).
; We may also want to increase this number if we the storage location for
; resources has a low write speed (e.g. NFS). From the uWSGI sources,
; it looks like the default value is 4s.

; (Note that we are serving CKAN via http11-socket behind nginx).
; Otherwise, downloads will fail with `uwsgi_response_sendfile_do() TIMEOUT !!!`,
; because the client cannot download the file from nginx as fast as
; uWSGI can send the file to nginx. But in this case, we can really only
; have as many connections as we have workers.
; On the other hand, if we, set `proxy_max_temp_file_size 100000m;`
; in nginx, then all downloads will be cached by nginx. And nginx will
; handle all users. The purpose of setting `workers` to `4` in uWSGI
; is now only so that CKAN does not block for as long as it takes the
; system to copy the download from uwsgi to nginx's `proxy_temp_path`.
; In other words, CKAN will only be unresponsive if 4 downloads are
; started at the same time for as long as it takes the smallest download
; to be copied over the http socket from uWSGI to nginx.
; Good to know: nginx also caches uploads, so no uWSGI worker is
; blocked *during* an upload.
